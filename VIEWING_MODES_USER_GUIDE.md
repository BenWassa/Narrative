## Troubleshooting

**Inspect mode shows thumbnail instead of full photo**
- The app couldn't load the full resolution image
- Thumbnail is shown as fallback
- This may happen if the source file is no longer accessible

**Performance is slow in Inspect mode**
- Large high-resolution images take time to load
- Check your internet/disk speed
- The loading indicator appears while image loads

**Can't see the toggle buttons**
- Toggle buttons only appear when photos are loaded
- Make sure you have a folder or day selected in Gallery mode
